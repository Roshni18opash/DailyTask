 					What is a Demo?
Demo = showing + explaining, not just clicking.

This is a React + TypeScript Admin Panel with authentication and protected routes.
Login state is stored in localStorage and routes are protected.
Dashboard gives high-level system insights.
CRUD operations handled using React state.
Logout clears auth state and redirects securely.
This admin panel uses protected routes and a shared layout for all admin pages
App.tsx acts as the routing and authentication controller.
Currently data is static, next step is backend integration

PROTECTED ROUTE REVIEW

if (!isLoggedIn) {
  return <Navigate to="/login" replace />;
}
I created a reusable ProtectedRoute to secure admin pages.
What AdminLayout does:
Sidebar
Header
Outlet

Why this is professional:
No repeated UI
Central layout control
Easy to scale
I used nested routing with a shared admin layout.
Auth state is global
Page state is local
