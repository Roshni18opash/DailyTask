how to push code in new git acount in new vs code step by step
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a clear, step-by-step guide to push code to a new GitHub account using VS Code, starting from scratch. This works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

STEP 1: Create a GitHub repository (new account)
Go to https://github.com and log in to your new account

Click ➕ → New repository

Enter:

Repository name

Choose Public or Private

❗ Do NOT check:

“Add a README”

“Add .gitignore”

Click Create repository

Keep this page open (you’ll need the repo URL)

STEP 2: Install & verify Git
Check if Git is installed
Open VS Code → Terminal and run:

git --version
If not installed:

Download from https://git-scm.com

Install and restart VS Code

STEP 3: Configure Git for the new account
In VS Code terminal:

git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Username"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
Verify:

git config --global --list
STEP 4: Open your project in VS Code
Open VS Code

Click File → Open Folder

Select your project folder

STEP 5: Initialize Git in your project
In VS Code terminal:

git init
Check status:

git status
STEP 6: Add files and make first commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
STEP 7: Connect local project to GitHub repo
Copy your repo URL from GitHub (HTTPS recommended).

git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
Verify:

git remote -v
STEP 8: Push code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
Login popup appears
Username → GitHub username

Password → ❗ GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

STEP 9: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (if asked)
Go to GitHub → Settings

Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)

Click Generate new token

Select scopes:

✅ repo

Generate token

Copy it (you won’t see it again)

Use it as password in VS Code

STEP 10: Confirm push
Refresh your GitHub repository page
✅ Your code should now be there

OPTIONAL: Push future changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push
BONUS: Using VS Code UI instead of terminal
Click Source Control icon (left sidebar)

Click Initialize Repository

Stage files ➕

Commit

Click Publish Branch

Common Problems & Fixes
❌ “Permission denied”

Wrong GitHub account logged in

Wrong PAT

❌ “remote origin already exists”

git remote remove origin
If you want:

🔑 Multiple GitHub accounts

🖥 SSH instead of HTTPS

📦 Pushing an existing repo

🪟 Windows-specific setup

This error means Git is NOT installed (or not added to PATH) on your Windows system.
Follow these steps exactly and you’ll be fine 👍

STEP 1: Download Git for Windows
Open this link in your browser:
👉 https://git-scm.com/download/win

The download will start automatically

Open the downloaded .exe file

STEP 2: Install Git (IMPORTANT OPTIONS)
During installation, keep default settings, but pay attention to these screens:

✔️ When you see:
“Adjusting your PATH environment”
👉 Select “Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software”
(This is VERY IMPORTANT)

✔️ Default editor
Choose:

Use Visual Studio Code as Git’s default editor (recommended)

✔️ All other screens
Just click Next → Next → Install

STEP 3: Restart VS Code (Required)
❗ Close VS Code completely
❗ Reopen VS Code

Then open Terminal again and run:

git --version
You should now see something like:

git version 2.x.x.windows.x
STEP 4: If it still doesn’t work (Backup Fix)
Open Windows PowerShell (Admin) and run:

$env:Path
Check if you see something like:

C:\Program Files\Git\cmd
If NOT:

Press Windows + R

Type sysdm.cpl → Enter

Go to Advanced → Environment Variables

Under System variables, select Path

Click Edit

Click New, add:

C:\Program Files\Git\cmd
Click OK → OK

Restart your PC

STEP 5: Continue with GitHub push
After Git works, run these commands:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Then tell me:

✅ Do you already have a GitHub repository?

✅ Are you using one or multiple GitHub accounts?

I’ll guide you step by step from there, no skipping 🚀

You said:
*** Please tell me who you are.

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got 'Admin@DESKTOP-620SGN0.(none)')

Perfect 👍 — this is a very common and normal Git message.
Git just needs to know your name and email before it can create a commit.

Follow these steps exactly.

STEP 1: Set your Git identity (one time only)
In VS Code → Terminal (PowerShell) run:

git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Username"
git config --global user.email "yourgithubemail@example.com"
Example (replace with YOUR details):
git config --global user.name "john123"
git config --global user.email "john123@gmail.com"
💡 Use the same email that you used for your GitHub account (recommended).

STEP 2: Verify the configuration
Run:

git config --global --list
You should see:

user.name=...
user.email=...
STEP 3: Commit again
Now retry your commit:

git commit -m "Initial commit"
✅ This time it will work.

OPTIONAL (Repository-only identity)
If you don’t want global settings, you can set it only for this project:

git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your@email.com"
STEP 4: Continue pushing to GitHub
Once commit succeeds, next steps will be:

git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
You’re doing great so far 👌
After you run the commit again, copy-paste the output here, and I’ll guide you to the final push step 🚀

PS C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\FSD\Even&OddNumbers> git push -u origin main
error: src refspec main does not match any
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Roshni18opash/Day-2-Odd_Even-Number-.git'
ChatGPT said:
No worries 👍 — this error is very common and easy to fix.

❌ Error meaning
src refspec main does not match any
This means there is no branch called main yet, usually because:

The first commit did not happen, or

Your branch is named master, not main

Let’s fix it step by step.

STEP 1: Check if a commit exists
Run:

git status
If you see something like:

No commits yet
👉 then you must commit first.

Do this:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
STEP 2: Check your current branch name
Run:

git branch
Possible results:
Case A: You see * master
That means your branch is master, not main.

Fix (rename master → main):
git branch -M main
Case B: You see * main
Good — continue to Step 3.

Case C: No branch shown
That means no commit exists → go back to STEP 1.

STEP 3: Verify remote URL
Run:

git remote -v
You should see:

origin  https://github.com/Roshni18opash/Day-2-Odd_Even-Number-.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Roshni18opash/Day-2-Odd_Even-Number-.git (push)
If NOT, add it again:

git remote add origin https://github.com/Roshni18opash/Day-2-Odd_Even-Number-.git
STEP 4: Push again
Now run:

git push -u origin main
✅ This should work.

QUICK FIX (if you want one command)
If you’re stuck, run all of these in order:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Roshni18opash/Day-2-Odd_Even-Number-.git
git push -u origin main
If it STILL fails
Copy-paste the output of:

git status
git branch
I’ll debug it for you instantly 💪
